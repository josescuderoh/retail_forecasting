# Summary

A large north american retailer  operates 11,450 stores in 27 countries, managing inventory across varying climates and cultures. Extreme weather events, like hurricanes, blizzards, and floods, can have a huge impact on sales at the store and product level. 

They want to accurately predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread, and milk) around the time of major weather events at 45 of their retail locations. 

Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big thunderstorm, but it's difficult for replenishment managers to correctly predict the level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and after that storm. They rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales around extreme weather events, but it's an ad-hoc and time-consuming process that lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. 

## Assumptions

1. Stations are within the same city

## Data preprocessing

1. We are going to analyze how different the temperature conditions are from station to station, to see if the sales data can be aggregated or there should be a model for each store.
